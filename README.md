Abstract from paper

We present a semi-supervised model
for object detection tasks. The goal is to accurately
predict bounding boxes and their labels
for objects inside images. Our dataset comprises
512,000 unlabeled 224Ã—224 images and 50,000
labeled images of various sizes that we split 60:40
for training and validation purposes. The number
of objects we train our model to recognize
is 100. We approach the task by training a selfsupervised
model to learn visual representations
from the unlabeled dataset and feed this trained
model as a backbone to a downstream task that
outputs bounding boxes and labels. We then finetune
the whole model in a supervised fashion with
the labeled dataset. We utilize SimCLR (Chen
et al., 2020), a contrastive technique, as the framework
to train the ResNet-18 backbone and Faster
R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015) for the downstream
object detection task. Overall, we achieved an
Average Precision (AP) - Intersection of Union
(IoU)=0.50:0.95 - of 0.093 on the validation set
after training for ten epochs.
